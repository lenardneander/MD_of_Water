# MD of Water
Welcome to the Water-MD Semester project! :rocket:

## Getting started
If you are using conda, a working conda environment with all the necessary packages can be installed from the environment.yml file.
To install, switch to the main directory and run
```
conda env update --file environment.yml --prune
```  
This should setup an environment called waterMD with the necessary packages.
To run your code, activate the environment via
```
conda activate waterMD
```
Simulation can be started via Jupyter notebook "start_simulation.ipynb". Useful plots will also be displayed in the notebook.
Results for the simulation will be placed in the folder "Simulation_Results". In order to visualize the simulation the pdb file has to be imported into the software VMD.
