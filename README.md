# MD of Water
Welcome to the Water-MD Semester project! :rocket:

## Getting started
If you are using conda, a working conda environment with all the necessary packages can be installed from the environment.yml file.
To install, switch to the main directory and run
```
conda env update --file environment.yml --prune
```  
This should setup an environment called waterMD with the necessary packages.
To run your code, activate the environment via
```
conda activate waterMD
```
And if you need new packages, please append them to the list (dependencies) in the environment.yml file.  
In case you run into trouble, please let me (b√∂rries) know.
